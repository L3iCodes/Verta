# Verta

**A React-based Realtime chat application**  

Verta is designed as a sample messaging application where users can sign up, log in, customize their profile, and chat in real time. The project serves as a playground for learning full-stack development, experimenting with UI/UX design (**utilizing Daisy UI**), and practicing real-time features with **WebSockets.io**.
